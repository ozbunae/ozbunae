- 👋 Hi, I’m Andrew Ozbun

- 👀 I’m interested in Data Science, Data Analytics, Data Engineering, and all things related to data.  
I originally fell in love with data from researching what I would find in the news.  To me, proper data visualization
is one of the most impressive way to convey very esoteric concepts.  I also find Time Series extremely fascinating.

- 🌱 I graduated from Boston University Metropolitan College in May 2023 with a Master's in Applied Data Analytics.
  
- 💞️ When I am not working with data I can be found in the park, going on hikes, at the theatre, or working on a craft project.
