- 👋 Hi, I’m Andrew Ozbun

- 👀 I’m interested in Data Science, Data Analytics, Data Engineering, and all things related to data.  
I originally fell in love with data from researching what I would find in the news.  To me, proper data visualization
is one of the most impressive way to convey very esoteric concepts.  I also find Time Series extremely fascinating.

- 🌱 I just recently graduated from Flatiron School Bootcamp where I built the foundations for machine learning.  
I started classes for graduate school this summer (2021) at Boston University.

- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on beginning projects.  I am at the beginning of my data career and would like a team
I can grow with.
