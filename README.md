- 👋 Hi, I’m Andrew Ozbun

- 👀 I’m interested in Data Science, Data Analytics, Data Engineering, and all things related to data.  
I originally fell in love with data from researching what I would find in the news.  To me, proper data visualization
is one of the most impressive way to convey very esoteric concepts.

- 🌱 I’m currently learning Data Science at Flatiron School in NYC and graduate with my certificate in April 2021.
I originally majored in Musical Theatre back in the early 2000s and I am using this course to help make the switch.
I am applying to grad schools for fall 2021.

- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on beginning projects.  I am at the beginning of my data career and would like a team
I can grow with.
